# Time-Series-Analysis-on-the-Central-England-Temperature
In this project, I conducted multiple time series analyses on the Central England Temperature (CET) record, the longest series of monthly temperature observation in existence, to study global temperature trend since the 18 century. Kernel-smoothed linear model, quardratic model, and ARIMA model were used to study the general trend, century-specific trend, and periodic trend of CET record.
